## Installation

After cloning the repository, type:
```
npm install
```
to install all dependencies

## Usage

To start the express server, type:
```
npm start
```
or
```
node ./server.js
```

If you are actively debugging and making changes to the code, type:
```
npm run debug
```
which will run the application with nodemon, allowing changes to be reflected automatically without restarting the server. However, the html page will still need to be refreshed.
